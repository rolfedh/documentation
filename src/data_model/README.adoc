==  Using the data model

The logging data model is defined by  `.yaml` files in link:model/[] .
Top level fields that can appear in any log record are defined in `namespaces/top-level.yaml.
The remaining files define groups of related fields that appear in some types of record.
Some fields are marked "private" meaning they are internal to the logging system, users should not rely on them,

The model can be used to generate code or documentation.
The `Makefile` generates simple AsciiDoc reference documents, using Go templates.
There are two versions: link:private/[] is the complete model link:public/[] only includes public fields.

Go to  link:../../docs/data_model/index.html[] to view the generated documents.
