      UTC value marking when the log payload was created, or when log payload was first collected if the creation time is not known;
      this is the log processing pipeline’s “best effort” determination of when the log payload was generated
      FYI: the “@” prefix convention to note a field as being reserved for a particular use; in this case, most tools by default look for “@timestamp” with ElasticSearch
  - name: hostname
    type: keyword
    description: |
      FQDN of the entity generating the original payload.  This field
      is a best effort attempt to derive this context; sometimes the entity generating
      it knows it; other times that entity has a restricted namespace itself, and
      the collector or normalizer knows that.

      Logging level as provided by: rsyslog(severitytext property), python's
      logging module, etc.
      Possible values are as listed here: http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l74 plus `trace` and `unknown`
      That is: alert crit debug emerg err info notice trace unknown warning
      Note that `trace` isn't in the syslog.h list but many applications use it
      `unknown` is only used when the logging system gets a value it doesn't understand
      `unknown` is the highest level
      `trace` should be considered as higher (more verbose) than `debug`
      `error` should be converted to `err`
      `panic` should be converted to `emerg`
      `warn` should be converted to `warning`
      Numeric values from syslog/journal PRIORITY can usually be mapped using the priority values as listed here:
      http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l51
      That is, 0 -> emerg, 1 -> alert, ..., 7 -> debug, 8 -> trace, 9 -> unknown
      Log levels/priorities from other logging systems should be mapped to the nearest match
      For example, from python logging: https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html#logging-levels
      CRITICAL -> crit, ERROR -> err, ...., DEBUG -> debug

      For example, syslog''s APP-NAME and rsyslog''s programname property are mapped
      to the service field.

    description: 'Optionally provided operator defined list of tags placed on each

      string tokens, or a JSON list of string tokens.

    type: long
    description: 'The offset value can represent bytes to the start of the log line
      in the file (zero or one based), or log line numbers (zero or one based), so
      long as the values are strictly monotonically increasing in the context of a
      single log file. They values are allowed to wrap, representing a new version
      of the log file (rotation).

      Associate this record with the namespace with this name.
      This value will not be stored.  It is only used to associate the
      record with the appropriate namespace for access control and
      visualization.  Normally this value will be given in the tag, but if the
      protocol does not support sending a tag, this field can be used.
      If this field is present, it will override the
      namespace given in the tag or in kubernetes.namespace_name.
      The format is the same format used for Kubernetes namespace names.
      See also namespace_uuid.
  - name: namespace_uuid

      The uuid associated with the namespace_name.
      This value will not be stored.  It is only used to associate the
      record with the appropriate namespace for access control and
      visualization.  If this field is present, it will override the
      uuid given in kubernetes.namespace_uuid.  This will also cause
      the Kubernetes metadata lookup to be skipped for this log record.

      A unique ID assigned to each message.  The format is not specified.
      It may be a UUID or a Base64 or some other ascii value.
      This is currently generated by
      https://github.com/uken/fluent-plugin-elasticsearch/tree/v1.13.2#generate-hash-id
      and is used as the `_id` of the document in Elasticsearch.
      An intended use of this field is that if you use another logging
      store or application other than Elasticsearch, but you still need
      to correlate data with the data stored in Elasticsearch, this field
      will give you the exact document corresponding to the record.

      For Elasticsearch 6.x and later this is a name of a write index alias. The value depends on a log type
      of this message. Detailed documentation is found at
      https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/cluster-logging/cluster-logging-es-rollover-data-design.md#data-model

      For Elasticsearch 5.x and earlier an index name in which this message will be stored within the Elasticsearch.
      The value of this field is generated based on the source of the message. Example of the value
      is 'project.my-cool-project-in-lab04.748e92c2-70d7-11e9-b387-000d3af2d83b.2019.05.09'.
