WARNING: Under Construction

ViaQ is a project to create components for collecting, forwarding and storing logs on kubernetes clusters.
These components are used by https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/logging/cluster-logging.html[Openshift Logging] to build a complete cluster logging system.

This is for developers and documentation writers working on the ViaQ and Openshift Logging,  and also anyone who wants to learn about the inner workings of Openshift Logging works.
